Objective: Animate Otero Assassins

TODO:
[x] Print general information
[x] Prompt user for whether they want instructions about Assassins
[x] Load data from game
[x] Create graph representing players
[x] Use matplotlib to animate the game / pylab
  [x] Delete a node for each player out
  [x] Redraw the graph
  [x] Highlight killer/killee (dict of attributes)

For future:
[] Look at graph-tools
[] Actually animate network rather than just redrawing (show FDLA in progress)
